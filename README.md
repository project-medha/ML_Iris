# Iris Dataset Analysis Using PCA, SVC, and K-Fold Cross Validation

**Project Overview**

This project demonstrates the application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, Support Vector Classifier (SVC) for classification, and K-Fold Cross Validation for model evaluation on the Iris dataset. The Iris dataset is a popular dataset in machine learning, containing information about three classes of Iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

**Features of the Project**

1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA):
    - Reduces the dimensionality of the dataset from 4 features to 2 principal components.
    - Aims to visualize the dataset in 2D while retaining most of the variance.
2. Support Vector Classifier (SVC):
    - Implements SVM with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel.
    - Classifies the Iris flowers based on the reduced dataset.
3. K-Fold Cross Validation:
    - Evaluates the SVC model's performance using stratified 5-fold cross-validation.
    - Ensures robust evaluation by splitting the data into different training and testing sets.
